# RawPrint

RAW Print allows sending RAW data directly to local printers through http://localhost:9100.  This is useful for label printing applications.

RAW Print functions as a Windows Service. You can try it out [here](https://trehoffman.github.io/RawPrint).

I was inspired to write this by programs like [KwickPython](https://kwickpos.com/opensource/index.php) and [Zebra Browser Print](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/products/software/barcode-printers/link-os/browser-print.html).
